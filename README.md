Coder modules for backdrop
---------------------------

If you are here looking for the coder module for Backdrop, you probably want
one of these two projects instead:

* [Coder review](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/coder_review) - Reviews
  your code identifying coding style problems and where updates to the API are
  required.

* [Coder Upgrade](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/coder_upgrade) - Helps
  automate some/most of the work required to upgrade a module from Drupal to
  Backdrop 1.x

If you are porting a module from Drupal 7 to Backdrop, you will probably need
both.
